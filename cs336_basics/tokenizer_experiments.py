# (a) Sample 10 documents from TinyStories and OpenWebText. Using your previously-trained 
# TinyStories and OpenWebText tokenizers (10K and 32K vocabulary size, respectively), 
# encode these sampled documents into integer IDs. What is each tokenizer’s compression ratio 
# (bytes/token)?
# Deliverable: A one-to-two sentence response.
# (b) What happens if you tokenize your OpenWebText sample with the TinyStories tokenizer? 
# Compare the compression ratio and/or qualitatively describe what happens.
# Deliverable: A one-to-two sentence response.
# (c) Estimate the throughput of your tokenizer (e.g., in bytes/second). How long would it take to 
# tokenize the Pile dataset (825GB of text)?
# Deliverable: A one-to-two sentence response.
# (d) Using your TinyStories and OpenWebText tokenizers, encode the respective training and 
# development datasets into a sequence of integer token IDs. We’ll use this later to train our 
# 12
# language model. We recommend serializing the token IDs as a NumPy array of datatype 
# uint16. Why is uint16 an appropriate choice?
